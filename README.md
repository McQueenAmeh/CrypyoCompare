# CrypyoCompare

This project is done for the Andela Assesment.

It's main function is to get data -- Cryptocurrency equivalent of Bitcoin or Etherium with respect to any 20 African currencies -- from 
a site's API, CrytoCompare.

The project doesn't have the finest designs and implementations due to the reason that i started late and had to familiarize my self with 
basic concepts, which i knew next tonothing about, such as getting data from a sites API and parsing them into data fit for display.

Although the project does the basic requirements instructed by andela.
